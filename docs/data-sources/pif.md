# xenorchestra_pif (Data Source)

Provides information about a physical network interface (PIF) of a XenServer host specified by the interface name or whether it is the management interface.

**Note:** If there are multiple PIFs that match terraform will fail.
Ensure that your device, vlan, host_id and other arguments identify a unique PIF.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "xenorchestra_pif" "eth0" {
  device = "eth0"
  vlan   = -1
}

resource "xenorchestra_vm" "demo-vm" {
  // ...
  network {
    network_id = data.xenorchestra_pif.eth0.network
  }
  // ...
}
```
